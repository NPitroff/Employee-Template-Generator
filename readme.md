## Generating a webpage for User information cards

This project is meant to showcase creating webpages through 'Node' using `OOPS` (Object Oriented Programming Structure)

By using the lessons from `OOPS`, we are able to truncate the amount of typing needed to create similar objects,
and also add any aditional bits of information to those objects as deemed necessary. 

##
The end result is being able to create a website with:
1) An `Engineer`, `Intern`, & `Manager` class type to utilize specific templates that can be loaded on the web page

2)Full customization of the different class parameters that we have chosen (Fill in Name, email, and employee ID etc)

3) Immediate launch and rendering of that information in succinct id cards for clients to view

##
This was made possible by using the npm packages of `Inquirer` and `Jest` to not only create the prompts needed to 
fill in the information requested, but to also test that everything was working correctly

By assuring that everything was operational, we could code line by line to discover any bugs and quickly resolve
any and all issues that may have came up.
